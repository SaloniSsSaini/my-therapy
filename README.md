# Grow My Therapy – Frontend Internship Assignment

A fully responsive, design-forward therapy website built using **Next.js (App Router)** and **Tailwind CSS**, created as part of the **Stage 2 Practical Assignment** for the Grow My Therapy Frontend Internship.

This project simulates real client work by cloning an existing layout and then redesigning it using a fictional therapist profile, focusing on UI accuracy, thoughtful design, clean architecture, and clear communication.
